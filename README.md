## Contents
Here you will find the following folders and files:

### Constraint File:
This folder contains the constraint file used to test the instructions on the FPGA Nexys A7 board. 


### Source Files:
This folder contains all of the necessary modules that are used to make the RISCV processor.\
The top module in this folder is the CPU.v folder, as it combines all the other modules together making the processor. 

### Test Cases:
This folder contains four test text files that are used to check the functionality
 of all of the 40 instructions.\
 A photo with the same name as the text file is also attached to show working simulation. 

### Test Benches:
This folder only contains the test bench file that is used to run and simulate 
all the test cases, including the ones mentioned above.

### MS_2 Report:
This word document contains the schematic of our design, as well as a brief
discrption of all the main modules used and how they function.
